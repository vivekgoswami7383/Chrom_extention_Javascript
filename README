1) Manifest.json is a file for handling chrom extention information like what the chrom extention name will be,
2) We must have provide version of the chrom extention
3) In the browser_action we have to give file name which will run as a index
3) Permission: There are some things in chrom extentions that will need for permission like storage and idle permission we hvae passed  so that we can use thier storage and idle.
If you want to use more features just add that into permission.
